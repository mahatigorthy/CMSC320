CMSC320 is an introductory course to data science, which forms the foundation for many AI applications, rather than a core AI course. The course covers the entire data science pipeline, from messy data to actionable insights, including statistical data analysis, data mining, basic machine learning, and large-scale data management. Its main topics are data analysis, data mining, machine learning algorithms, and information visualization, with an emphasis on practical application. 

Here are some of my most notable projects.
